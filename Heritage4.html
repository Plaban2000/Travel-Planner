        <p>It was the Indian emperor Ashoka’s embrace of Buddhism in the 3rd century BC 
            that turned it into one of the world’s major religions. Here at Sanchi, you 
            can see the greatest tribute he built to his new faith – an enormous stupa 
            containing relics of Buddha himself. The intricate carved stone artworks telling 
            historical stories help make the Great Stupa of Sanchi one of the marvels of the 
            ancient world. Presently under an UNESCO project Sanchi and Satdhara, a Buddhist site,
             10 km south-east of Sanchi, is being further excavated, conserved and environmentally developed.

             paintings are among the world's oldest. The inscribed area consists of 5 
             clusters (5 hills) of in total ca. 400 shelters. The paintings, largely in 
             white and red, show the varied animal life which shared the forest environment 
             with the prehistoric people, and of the various facets - economic and social - of 
             the peoples' lives. Later more elaborate paintings such as large processions of men
              on horses and elephants, battle scenes depicting spears, bows, arrows, shields and 
              swords were added.More than 750 sandstone rock shelters have earned Bhimbetka the
               prestigious UNESCO World Heritage Site status.
