        <p>The Manas Wildlife Sanctuary or Manas National Park is a national park situated at 
            the Himalayan foothills of Assam in India. It is one of the best for wildlife in 
            Assam and among the top places to visit in Guwahati. Originally a game reserve since

            and a Biosphere Reserve in 1989. Then declared as a National Park in 1990. Contiguous 
            with the Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan, the park is known for its rare and 
            endangered endemic wildlife such as the Assam roofed turtle, hispid hare, red panda, 
            golden langur, and pygmy hog. Manas is famous for its population of wild water buffalos. 
            Manas is recognized not only for its rich biodiversity but also for its spectacular 
            scenery and natural landscape which includes a range of forested hills, sedimentary grasslands, 
            and tropical evergreen forests. It was also named one of the World Heritage Sites in Danger but was 
            restored after extensive conservation efforts in 2011.
